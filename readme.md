## Knowledge Graphs for RAG

Knowledge graphs enhance AI application development by connecting structured and unstructured data sources for a comprehensive view of complex, real-world scenarios. They go beyond traditional databases as they connect data from both structured and unstructured sources, providing an intuitive way to model complex, real-world scenarios.

It is a content of the short course built in collaboration with Neo4j, where youâ€™ll learn how to leverage knowledge graphs within retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications.
